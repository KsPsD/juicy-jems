### Usage


## Smart Contracts
Our team focused on the fact that physical assets such as real estate can be mapped to virtual assets, and that cash can also play a role like RWA, so we use smart contracts to issue tokens for deposited cash and receive additional compensation accordingly. User participation was encouraged through this. Users can receive compensation for game goods through additionally provided tokens. For example, a user can spend a certain amount of tokens to acquire rare goods on a specific gaming platform through a reliable probability created by a smart contract. By building an architecture through polygon-based zk-evm and user raw transactions, it is fast and has low accessibility.
